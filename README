Reddit activity analysis
========================

Summary
=======
This repository contains scripts to analyse user activities on the website http://reddit.com. Included are:

* A python script to stream xz files downloaded from pushshift.io/reddit/comments/ and enter them into a SQLite database.
* A SQLite script to trim bot comments and subreddits/users with low comment counts from the data.
* R files for:
  * Data preparation
  * Analysing post frequencies by user
  * Community detection using clustering methods
  * Analysis of day-and-hourly patterns of activity by user and subreddit

Technical note
==============

To perform high-dimensional LDA we use the `lda.svi` package, which must be patched (using the patchfile in patch/ directory) to work on generic sparse matrices.
