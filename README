Reddit activity analysis
========================

Summary
=======
This repository contains scripts to analyse user activities on the website http://reddit.com. Included are:

* A Python script to stream xz files downloaded from http://pushshift.io/reddit/comments/ and enter them into a SQLite database.
* A SQLite script to trim bot comments and subreddits/users with low comment counts from the data.
* R files for:
  * Data preparation
  * Analysing post frequencies by user
  * Community detection using clustering methods
  * Analysis of day-and-hourly patterns of activity by user and subreddit

Technical note
==============

To perform high-dimensional LDA we use the `lda.svi` package, which must be patched (using the patchfile in patch/ directory) to work on generic sparse matrices.

To do this, first download lda_svi from CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lda.svi/index.html
and extract to the patch/ directory.
Then, run the command `patch -p0 < patch_lda_svi.diff`
while in the patch/ directory.
Finally, compile and install the package by running:
R CMD build lda.svi_0.1.0 && R CMD install lda.svi_0.1.0.tar.gz
